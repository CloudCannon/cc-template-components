# CloudCannon Template Components
This repository is the home for CloudCannon Bookshop template components and theme files. This component library is shared across the Hydra, Justice, Urban and Cause templates. Components are interchangeable between templates and themes. When designing new components, they should be tested in all themes, and in theme-specific dark mode.

# Updating component library and themes across all templates
- Within the repository run the following command:
  `bash update-template-components.sh`
  The update script will then run through all templates and update components
- When prompted for a commit message type `i` to begin writing your commit message. Press `Esc` followed by `:wq` when finished.
